## Welcome

Welcome to the "Create Your First Website" bootcamp! Over the next three days, you'll transform from a complete beginner to someone who can build a functional, interactive website. By the end of this bootcamp, you'll have created your very own browser-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
